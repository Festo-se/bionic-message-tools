# PURPOSE
These tools were developed to enable a bidirectional communication with our hardware.
Currently they are used for the BionicSoftHand Project. It is possible to talk to the Hand with the UDP implementation.     
The serial communication is only for a specific sensor to test them independent from the other hardware.
